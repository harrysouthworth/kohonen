Description: Self-Organizing Maps are cluster analysis, they are
 searching for groups (clusters) in the data, in such a way that objects
 belonging to the same cluster are quite similar, whereas objects in
 different clusters are dissimilar. They are also providing topological
 informations on the data ; the clusters are organised so that relative
 distances between groups on the grid reflect dissimilarities between
 groups in the data. Self-Organizing Maps have been used in several
 fields: voice recognition, image processing, process control, text
 analysis, genomic analysis... The package provide various tools for SOM:
 creation and learning, summary, print methods, groups extraction, plot
 methods, etc. Numerical and factorial variables are allowed in the data.
